  ✨ Phase 2: Printing the Test Model
    </h3>
<p>I choose to use Kodama model (1st one) as my test print. I downloaded and imported the .stl file of the model (collected from Thingiverse.com) into Cura in order to set up the Gcode files for two 3D printers: LulzBot Mini 2 and LulzBot TAZ 5. </p>
<img src="images/a4-kodama-cura.jpg" width=100%>
<p>Once done, I used a SD Card to save the Gcode files and than insert the card into one of the printer to start printing. For this test print, I used LulzBot TAZ 5.

  ✨ Phase 5-6-7: Printing and Documentation
    </h3>
<img src="images/a4-sonarwave-cura.jpg" width="100%" ><p>I imported the .stl file of my model to Cura to make Gcode for 3D printer. I used LulzBot Mini 2 for this one. The printing time was about 2hr 10min. </p>
<img src="images/a4-sonarwave-wip.jpg" width="49%">
<img src="images/a4-sonarwave-wip1.jpg" width="49%">
<p> Once it start printing, I then realized that the support would be very difficult to remove from the main object due to how thin the seaweeds and the connection between it and the seashells.  </p>
<img src="images/a4-sonarwave-broken.jpg" width="49%">
<img src="images/a4-sonarwave-fix.jpg" width="49%">

<p>I accidentally broke it while putting it in my backpack. Yes, I was quite panicked. I then tried my best to fix it by using super glue. I let it sit like that for one day and eventually it got back to its normal shape.</p>

  ✨ Phase 8: Final Documentation

	<h4>Part 1: The Story</h4>
<p>In the world where mermaids exist…
<br><br>
Under the sea, it’s a world full of sounds. Sounds travel four times faster in water than in air, which makes sounds much louder underwater. 
<br>
Just like other sea species, Mermaids get used to having extremely sensitive hearing ability. 
They are unable to filter out environmental sounds due to how loud and noisy the underwater is. 
On top of that, it is even more difficult for them to hear outside of the water because sounds are much quieter for them. 
<br>In order to focus on specific soundwaves or frequencies, a new device is created...
<br><br>Introducing: SonarWave - a headphone device with an amplifier and sonar system that can help mermaids channeling, compressing, and filtering sound signals both underwater and on land. 

<br><br>SonarWave allows for more complex processing of sound during the amplification process which may improve sound performance in certain situations.
With SonarWave, not only can users filter out noise, but also they can increase the signal of sound as they want. For example, in order to hear above the water more clearly, they can switch to “Air Mode” and use the dial to boost their hearing ability. 

<br><br>The environment switch will dim the noise level by 60dB for “Air mode,” and hitting “Underwater mode” it will go back to normal. 

<br>Using SonarWave, mermaids now listen to sounds more clearly, either it is a beautiful whale song from thousands of miles away, to communicate, or to experience humans’ hearing ability on land. 

<br><br>Mermaids now can experience sounds in the best possible way as they desire, thanks to SonarWave.

<p>The 3D model is then painted by me. I intentionally mixed different paint colors together and made the texture look rough and organic instead of smooth and well-mixed. </p>

<h4>Artist Statement </h4>
	<p>Another project that I had so much fun with! I learned so much about steps to create a product object, from researching to studying more about the subject, then coming up with ideas and concepts, then testing and experiencing, and finally designing and printing. Even though it might feel like a lot, but I learned how to document each steps and I think it is just so important that I record every stages of the making. I understand more about the creative process behind a product, and enjoy the final result. I think this project is really helpful for me in the future if I ever work on a product design, or concept design, or product promotional job. I make me think deeper about the meaning of the product and all the questions about its purpose of creation.  
	</p>
	<p>Lastly, I would like to thank professor Steve for teaching us this course, his hard work and dedication, and for making us do amazing things that we would never think we could do!</p>

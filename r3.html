    <h2>Reading #3, Artifacts and Material Speculation
    </h2>
    <h5>Q1 -- From the podcast, how has our understanding of what dinoasaurs really look like evolved? Describe the progression of how we portrayed them and how might this effect our understanding of what Archeology is saying about them.
    </h5>
    <p><ul>
      <li>Our understanding of what dinosaurs really look like evolved from seeing evidence such as fossilized bones of dinosaurs, using knowledge of anatomy study, imagining, making theories accordingly, and then coming up with the concept of possible dinosaurs’ body, flesh, sizes… with as much of the information provided as possible. After that, we also picture them in sceneries, activities as they have social intelligence, and presume how they move, what they eat, how they live, what their habits are, what their appearances are, etc. Not only thinking about the interactions between the same dinosaur kind, we also question what other kinds of living creatures are that also live in the same environment.
        </li>
      <li>Archeology is conceptually reconstructing the image of something that happened in history with limited information provided through evidence and study, trying to come up with answers even though there are probably more to secrets and possibilities that we just never know.
        </li>
</ul>
      </p>
<h5>Q2. The artist/archcologist John Conway who is doing interpretaions of dinosaurs is obviously taking liberty with what could be the actual truth of how these creatures existed. What other fields of science, creative based disciplines and forms of studies use similer techniques that reminds you of this method or process. Please elaborate with your examples both written as well as images and links.
  </h5>
  <p>Other fields of science, creative based disciplines and forms of studies use similar techniques that reminds you of this method or process:
    <ul>
    <li><b>Science-based:</b> Doctor. For example, by looking at patience's sickness symptoms, and with their knowledge of medical field, they can diagnose and make a prescription for the patience to cure the sickness.
    However, not many diseases are easily diagnosed, and not all diseases are known and named. Therefore, in many cases, doctors have to do examinations on the patience, study the symptoms well enough in order to make the best diagnosis.
<li><b>Creative-based:</b> Concept Designer/ Artist. To create a character or object that is believable according to a theme, they have to study the era that the character/ object came from, what their origin was, what their cultures look like, their actions or their usage/ meaning, etc.
<li>Other answers from in-class discussion:
<ul>
<li>Astrology</li>
<li>Astronomy</li>
<li>Geology</li>
<li>Crime/ detective</li>
<li>4th/ 5th Dimension (Science/Physics?)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</p>
<h5>Q3. First, summerize in your own words the defination of 'Material Speculation' as described in the second and fourth article. Then, given the examples in the second article as well as the other examples provided of possible future products, how can 'Material Speculation' also be used to create speculative objects that refer to the past? What might be an example of a fictional object form the past, that creates the same dynamic of speculation.
  </h5>
<p>
Material Speculation are designs/ creations that represent for a concept, assumption, or idea about things that is not exist in reality, or impossible at the current time.
</p>

<h5>Q4. Group discussion
  </h5>
  <p>VAN'S SUPPOSITION:
  <ul>
    <li><b>Cultures:</b>
   <i> "If everyone speaks to each other by singing, the world would be like a musical. And their style of speaking is based on their music tastes."</i>
<br><ul>
  <li>Mandy:
 If everyone speaks to each other by singing, I may have a bad vocal when I am speaking to others. It will also feels like Disney movies.
<li> Deana:
This is a funny idea as if reminds me a lot of high school musical; it would be really fun but would that mean listening to music it would be like people talking normally?
<li>Avery:
This would make life more lively! If people sing bad would that just be considered normal talking still?
</ul>
<br>
<li><b>Lifeform:</b>
<i>"In a world where sleep is not mandatory in life, people can do more things that they like."</i>
<br><ul>
<li>Mandy:
  It will be cool but it also comes with a problem that if we don’t see, we will 24 hour a day to speed up the use of resources of the planet.
<li> Deana: I wish this was real especially with finals coming up; i love to sleep but i could really use the time i spend sleeping to work on assignments
<li>Avery: We could use this time to do more things and maybe our days may get shorter due to this or longer due to one’s productivity level
</ul>
<br>
<li><b>Technology:</b>
<i>" If teleportation is real, then traffic would not be an issue. Just by closing your eyes and thinking of the place, you can be put in a queue and arrive at the destination according to your order number. There would be no need to use transportation, and everyone would be able to go to places in just a short amount of time."</i>
<br><ul>
<li>Mandy:
What if we accidentally think about going to other place during class, it will be very funny to despair in the classroom.
<li> Deana: This idea i think is really cool [and needed], i feel like some accidents that could happen with this would be what if someone thinks about the same exact place/spot as you and teleports at the same time; would you physically clash with one another like falling on top of each other?
<li>Avery: This would be very convenient and eco friendly since we would not need transportation. </ul>
<ul>

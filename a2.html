    ✨ Phase 1: Intro, Background and 4 Tessellation and Module Exercises with Scissors
    </h3>
    <p>Unfortunately, I was not able to attend class during this week, therefore I couldn’t
      participate in the beginning of this group project. However, I had a look at what my group
      mates and everyone else in the class were doing, so this is my attempt at making a simple
      modular.</p>
    <h4>
      Exercise 1 -- Simple Modular</h4>
    <p> I made an origami Paper Ninja Star following this <a href="https://youtu.be/RshX97WMWDw"> Youtube Tutorial <a></p>
    <img src="images/a2-1.jpg" width="500">
    <h4>
      Exercise 2 -- Tessellations and Modules </h4>
    <img src="images/a2-2.jpg" width="500">
    <p> I created a tessellating shape out of construction paper. Unable to be there in class
      with my group mates, however, I did my own version in which I made 3 different shapes
      tessellate with each other perfectly. This is the <a href="https://youtu.be/212XC1zfxXY">tutorial.</a></p>
    <h4>
      Exercise 3 -- Modular Origami with Groups</h4>
    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/JjVzFYRurIY">Tutorial.</a></p>
    <h4>
      Exercise 4 -- 3D Fastener BrainStorming Designs, Mockups and Design Approaches</h4>
    <p>I chose to work on Option B to use a thicker material, which is cardboard. I cut them
      into square shapes about 3x3 inches. The type of fastener that I chose is the Slotting Joint,
      which I made for cuts on each side of the square with the width equal to the thickness of the
      cardboard. My fastener can work on three dimensions, however the variety in shape is
      limited, which I will keep in mind in order to experiment and improve our coming project.</p>

     ✨ Phase 2 -- Digital based designs and 'Goldilocks' Fastener Laser tests Laser Cut
    </h3>
    <h4>
      Part 1: First Designs with Adobe Illustrator</h4>
    <img src="images/a2-4.jpg" width="750">
    <h4>
      Part 2: Digital Fastner Designs and Goldilocks tests</h4>
    <p>Our team work together to create a group of shapes for as test designs. The designs overall were unique and ceative.

    <p> Materials for test cut were pieces of .125" thick on a 15" x 30" birch plywood, and pieces of .0056" thick on a 12" width x 18" height black Plike.
      <br>After the the test, we all prefer the quality of plywood more as it is unbendable, firm, and heavier in weight comparing to paper or plike.
      <br>We then decided to use an alike thick material. We considered using clear acrylic plastic for our project.

    <h3 id=final> ✨ Final Documentation</h3>
    <h4> Artist Statement </h4>
    <p>This is a group project which we working together to create a modular system with our own designs. We had spent a lot of time figuring out ideas and which one work best in terms of timing. After all the discussions, we decided to go with making a data visualizer for emotions using acrylic designed pieces. Not only we learned a lot about class materials, but we also learned about each other as a group, who is best at doing what, managing time and tasks to make sure it is delivered on the due date. My favorite part of this project is filming footage as we have our designs printed. We gathered together and made short funny skits and film each other outside the classroom on campus, and had so much fun together. We also had boba after that!</p>

    <h4> Successes of the Project</h4>
    <p>"DVD" succeed in delivering an entertaining and meaningful message of visualizing your emotions in a specific period of time
      as to keep track of your overall mental health. Viewers are able to understand how to use it easily and enjoy interacting with the pieces, as well as coming up with their
      own unique interpretations and ideas for the designs.
      Technical wise, all pieces of designs are well created and nicely cut by the laser cutting machine.
      Material's quality is nice and satisfying to look at.
    </p>
    <h4> Future Improvements</h4>
    <p> Our group can improve this project by review each other's designs.
      I noticed that some of our designs unexpectedly broke when we tested attaching the pieces together.
      The reason for that was because those specific designs had too small and thin details near, or the line cut was too near the notches.
      Therefore, if just a bit of over forcing it would break that piece.
